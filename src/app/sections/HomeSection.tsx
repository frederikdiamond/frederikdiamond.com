                Without the freedom to use technology that empowers anonymity,
                we donâ€™t have any privacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                We see laws being proposed and passed that are in direct
                conflict with the right to privacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, the British government has proposed a bill that
                would make end-to-end encrypted messaging illegal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Governments around the world are at war with our rights to
                privacy. We must not let them win! Otherwise, we risk being on a
                path towards a tyrannical state, from which reversing course
                will not be easy.
